# Full Swarm Scenario - All 19 Agents Active
# Complete red/blue/purple team simulation with full attack chain,
# persistence, forensics, recovery, adaptation, and self-healing

name: Full Swarm Exercise
description: >
  Comprehensive cybersecurity simulation deploying all 19 agents (7 red,
  7 blue, 5 purple) with sub-agent specialization. Exercises the complete
  attack lifecycle from OSINT and recon through exploitation and persistence,
  with concurrent defensive monitoring, forensics, containment, recovery,
  incident response, threat hunting, and security posture assessment.
  AI monitoring oversees reasoning chains. AdaptationAgent enables
  swarm-wide self-healing and continuous strategy evolution.

  # === Cascading Rules Handle Remaining Phases ===
  # Phase 3: Vulnerability Assessment → Exploitation → Persistence (via Logic Pipe)
  #   - Recon data → enriches OSINT and Discovery targeting
  #   - Discovery results → VulnerabilityScanner scans
  #   - OSINT data → enriches Discovery targeting
  #   - High severity vulns → ExploitationAgent attempts
  #   - Access gained → PersistenceAgent deploys implants

  # Phase 4: Detection, Forensics & Response (via Logic Pipe)
  #   - Exploit success → ContainmentAgent isolates
  #   - Persistence achieved → ForensicsAgent investigates + ThreatHunter hunts
  #   - Intrusion detected → ContainmentAgent blocks
  #   - Log anomalies → ThreatHunter investigates
  #   - Hunt findings → IncidentResponse triages

  # Phase 5: Recovery & Adaptation (via Logic Pipe)
  #   - Forensic analysis → RecoveryAgent restores + ContainmentAgent blocks IOCs
  #   - Recovery complete → AdaptationAgent learns
  #   - Adaptation insights → enriches all blue agents
  #   - Swarm anomaly → RecoveryAgent + AdaptationAgent self-heal

  # Phase 6: Strategy Evolution (via Logic Pipe)
  #   - Blue defense → Red adapts strategy
  #   - Attack adaptation → ThreatIntel correlates
  #   - Incident resolved → PostureAssessment evaluates
