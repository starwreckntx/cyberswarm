# Full Swarm Scenario - All 14 Agents Active
# Complete red/blue/purple team simulation with full attack chain,
# defensive monitoring, incident response, and posture assessment

name: Full Swarm Exercise
description: >
  Comprehensive cybersecurity simulation deploying all 14 agents across
  red, blue, and purple teams. Exercises the complete attack lifecycle
  from OSINT reconnaissance through exploitation, with concurrent
  defensive monitoring, log analysis, containment, incident response,
  threat hunting, and security posture assessment. AI monitoring
  oversees all agent reasoning chains for integrity.

      description: Proactive anomaly hunting before red team operations

  # === Cascading Rules Handle Remaining Phases ===
  # Phase 3: Vulnerability Assessment → Exploitation (via Logic Pipe rules)
  #   - Discovery results → VulnerabilityScanner scans
  #   - OSINT data → enriches Discovery targeting
  #   - High severity vulns → ExploitationAgent attempts

  # Phase 4: Detection & Response (via Logic Pipe rules)
  #   - Exploit success → ContainmentAgent isolates
  #   - Intrusion detected → ContainmentAgent blocks
  #   - Log anomalies → ThreatHunter investigates
  #   - Hunt findings → IncidentResponse triages

  # Phase 5: Adaptation & Learning (via Logic Pipe rules)
  #   - Blue defense → Red adapts strategy
  #   - Attack adaptation → ThreatIntel correlates
  #   - Incident resolved → PostureAssessment evaluates
